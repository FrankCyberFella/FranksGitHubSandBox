# Review Day    

For this day, the instructor is free to review any concepts discussed in the class. They can also go through and build a small web application from scratch of their choosing. 

The lecture code repository should have a copy of this application that they build from scratch for future classes or requests to look at different projects.

Given that there are a few topics (Temporary Redirect Data / Flash Scope, Validation, and Hierarchical Data Models) remaining in the module, it might work out best if this project can be built to keep those topics in mind.
