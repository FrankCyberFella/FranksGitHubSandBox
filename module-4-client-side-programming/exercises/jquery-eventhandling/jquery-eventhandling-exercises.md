# JQuery Library Introduction Exercises

You'll use `events.html` and `events.js` to complete the below exercises. Don't forget to add the reference to the jQuery library before starting the exercise.

1. Add a click event handler to the "deepSkyBox" that displays an alert message: "Hey! You clicked me!" to the user. 

2. When any of the rainbow boxes are double clicked, show that they are selected by adding the "selected" class.

3. If any of the rainbow boxes are double clicked, unselect them by removing the "selected" class.     

4. When the "Hide Selected Boxes" button is clicked, hide any of the selected boxes from the page.

5. When the "Show All Boxes" button is clicked, show all of the boxes that are currently hidden.

6. When the "Refresh List" button is clicked, update the list items in the "selectedBoxList" with the names of each selected box (i.e. Box 1, Box 7, Box 8).  

7. Add a border (css class .selected-field) to the textboxes on the page when they receives focus. Remove the border when they loses focus.

8. In the Form Address section, when the user indicates that they have a different billing address by checking the "My billing address is different box", display the fields in the "billingAddress" box. Make sure to hide those fields again if the user unchecks it.  

9. As text is typed into the repeating text box repeat it out to the paragraph tag (#txtFieldOutput) element below it.

10. Add an event that when the "Check all below" checkbox is checked, all of the sub-checkboxes are also checked.  Make sure when the user unchecks it, all checkboxes below are unchecked. 

11. Make the swap buttons work. If the boxes in the 2-4 position are swapped, switch places with the box immediately preceding it (i.e. 3 is clicked therefore 3 and 2 swap places). If boxes in positions 5-7 are clicked swap places with the box immediately following it. For box 1 switches places with the box immediately following, and box 8 switch places with the box immediately before.
