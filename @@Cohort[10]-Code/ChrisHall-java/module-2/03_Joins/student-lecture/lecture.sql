-- Keys, Joins and Unions
--
-- Primary Key - a column or set of columns that uniquely identify a row in a table (Parent table)
-- Foreign Key - a column or set of columns that match the primary key of another table (Dependent table)
--
-- Natural Key - Value(s) that exist for a table that can be used as primary keys
-- Surrogate Key - Artificially generated keys to use as a primary key
--
--  Joins are used when columns from multiple tables are required in a query
--
-- INNER JOIN - Matching rows between tables 
-- 
-- OUTER JOIN - All rows from both tables - the full set      
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Inner Join syntax - 2 forms
-- 
--  SELECT columns
--    FROM table1, table2  
--  WHERE table1.column = table2.column  
--
--- If you omit join conditions, the result is Cartesian Product
--    -- get each row from one table with each row in the other -- It is NOT a JOiN
--  Rule of thumb : the minimum number of conditions on WHERE clause is # TABLES - 1

-- newer syntax to help avoid Cartesian

--  SELECT columns
--    FROM table1
--         INNER JOIN
--         table2
--      on table1.column = table2.column
--
-- Additional WHERE predicates may be added to either syntax to filter rows

--Show me last_name of all the actors in the movie FINDING ANACONDA
-- actor table...to get to film table to get film...need to go through film_actor table and the film table.  The film_table is a RELATOR.
-- need multiple tables, need JOIN
-- from needs actor, film_actor
-- What rows for film_actor? >> we want the rows where actor_id matches film_actor >> WHERE clause >> WHERE actor's actor_id = film_actor's actor_id 
--  >> ambiguous >> which actor_id ?? >> use dots and specify each table name >> actor.actor_id   and film_actor.actor_id
-- now connect film_actor to film with film_id >> add film to from and add "and film.film_id = film_actor.film_id" to the Where
-- now we need to limit films to the one we want (from film) add "and title = 'FINDING ANACONDA'"

-- Let's find out who made payment 16666:
-- what table for customer_id for payment_id = 16666?
select customer_id
from payment
where payment_id = 16666
;
-- gives 204  
-- Ok, that gives us a customer_id, but not the name. NEED data from two tables.  JOIN We can use the customer_id to get the name FROM the customer table
select customer.customer_id, first_name || ' ' || last_name  --  <<  note: need to specify the ambiguous possibities even on Select
from payment
        inner join

--  a Frank technique:  a correlation name (nickname or alias) can be assigned to a table to make coding easier:
-- also good to use the correlation name even when not necessary, to help point out which table a column is from: c.first_name

--  note p.* gets all colums
select p.*, c.customer_id, c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name  --  <<  note: need to specify the ambiguous possibities even on Select
from payment p  -- assigned correlation name p to the payment table
        inner join
        customer c  -- assign correlation name c to customer table

where p.payment_id = 16666

-- We can see --above--that the * pulls back everything from both tables. We just want everything from payment and then the first and last name of the customer:

-- But when did they return the rental? Where would that data come from? From the rental table, so letâ€™s join that.

-- What did they rent? Film id can be gotten through inventory.

-- What if we wanted to know who acted in that film?    

-- What if we wanted a list of all the films and their categories ordered by film title

-- Show all the 'Comedy' films ordered by film title

-- Finally, let's count the number of films under each category
