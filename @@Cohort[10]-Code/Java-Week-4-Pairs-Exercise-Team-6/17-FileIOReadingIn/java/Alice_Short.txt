'Tis two score years since CARROLL'S art,
             With topsy-turvy magic,
           Sent ALICE wondering through a part
             Half-comic and half-tragic._

          _Enchanting ALICE! Black-and-white
             Has made your deeds perennial;
           And naught save "Chaos and old Night"
             Can part you now from TENNIEL;_
