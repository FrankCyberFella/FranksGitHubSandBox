A. Application Framework 
 
1. Reveiw all Requirements 

 Classify Objects (Classes) vs Non-Objects (Functions) 
 
Objects (Classes) 
Vending Machine
Slots//Food and beverage dispenser
Items
Change Dispenser 
Checkout Buttons

	 	
Non-Objects (Functions) will turn into method
Payment Recieved
Display(See Items)
ItemRelease

   
   Menu
   display vending machine Items
   Purchase
   End
   
    Methods 
	
	Interfaces 
VendingMachineCLI is an interface (collection of methods) is provided. Do not add anything to this section. 
public static main(String args[])

2. Create Classes 

Vending Machine (Parent) 

Slots
 - Public double SlotsForFood()
 
Items
 - Public ints ItemstoEat()


Payment Options - Functions 
Select Item Device W/ Item Count - Functions
Change Dispense - Functions
Checkout Button - Functions

3. Declare any known methods for the interfaces and
declare variables (Has-A: data types) classes(Is-A: Inheritnce) 

B. Application Functionality (Start Working in Eclipse)
1. Create Class Constructors
2. Create Getters and Setters
3. Import any methods from implemented Interfaces //Interface aldready provided and extending it 
4. Add code to the methods to perform required
tasks/actions/functions
5. Create Unit Tests to verify methods
function properly.

C. Application User Experience
1. Develop code for user interaction (front-end code
or command line application
