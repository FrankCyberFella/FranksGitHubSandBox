1. Review Requirements
	What Classes and Methods do we need to create?
	Classes:
x	model classes
	interface classes
	concrete JDBC classes
x	Menu class (given)
	reservation class
	[secure log in stuff]

	Methods:
	within JDBCparkDAO: 
		selectAllParks
	within JDBCcampgroundDAO:
		selectAllCampgrounds(? IS THIS NECESSARY?)
		selectCampgroundsByParkId
	within JDBCsiteDAO:
		selectAvailableSitesByCampgroundId (available means the date span is available)
		selectAvailableSitesByParkId		(for the bonus challenge)
	within JDBCreservationDAO:
		createNewReservation
		viewReservations
		
	within reservation:
		acceptUserDateRange
		subMenuParkList(List<Park> parks)
		subMenuCampgroundList(List<Campground> campgrounds)
		
	
	
	Menu: how and when do we fill it out?
		option: VIEW PARKS (what makes it available? we should list it even if there's no spots? sort it alphabetically)
		option: VIEW CAMPGROUNDS - (View all campgrounds FOR A GIVEN PARK)
			sub-menu: list of parks
				sub-menu: list of campgrounds 
		option: MAKE A RESERVATION BY CAMPGROUND- (Select a campground and search for date availability)
			sub-menu: list of parks
				sub-menu: list of campgrounds 
					After selection:
					Enter date
					sub-menu:
						option: RESERVE: (1-5)(top five available should be displayed)
						option: CANCEL/RETURN/GOBACK/EXIT
		option: MAKE A RESERVATION BY PARK
			skip the list of campgrounds and go straight to:
				sub-menu:
					option: RESERVE: (1-5)(top five available should be displayed)
					option: CANCEL/RETURN/GOBACK/EXIT
		option: VIEW RESERVATIONS (use passwords and stuff?)
			
			
	
	
x2. Create classes

x3. Declare known methods for the interfaces

x4. Create properties and getters/setters

5. Fill out our menus in the CLI app to satisfy the user requirements (started)

x6. Create (blank) methods in the concrete class

7. Add code to the concrete class methods (not started)

8. Create tests for the methods
- copied the database in eclipse
- Made a database in DBVizulizer 
-created a new Database Connection for the test database.
- Connected the database with same name campgrount_test 


9. Make it nice and make it pretty. (eg close gracefully)
