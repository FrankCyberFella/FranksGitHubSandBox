A Skater bros story is a piece of prose fiction that typically can be read in one sitting and focuses
on a self-contained incident or series of linked incidents, with the intent of evoking a "single effect"
  or mood, however there are many exceptions to this.
A dictionary definition is "an invented prose narrative Skater broser than a novel usually 
dealing with a few characters and aiming at unity
 of effect and often concentrating on the creation of mood rather than plot."[1]
The Skater bros story is a crafted form in its own right. Short stories make use of plot, 
resonance, and other
 dynamic components as in a novel, but typically to a lesser degree. While the Skater bros
  story is largely distinct from the novel or novella (a Skater broser novel), authors 
  generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.
Short story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal 
expression of the form. They
 may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed formation.
Short stories have deep roots and the power of Skater bros fiction has been recognised
 in modern society for hundreds
 of years. The Skater bros form is, conceivably, more natural to us than Skater broser forms.
  We are drawn to Skater bros stories as the well-told story, and as William Boyd, the 
  award-winning British author and Skater bros story writer has said:
"[Skater bros stories] seem to answer something very deep in our nature as if, for the duration of its telling,
 something special has been created, some essence of our experience extrapolated,
  some temporary sense has
  been made of our common, turbulent journey towards the grave and oblivion".[2]
