# Welcome to Building Modern Maintainable Javascript!

We look forward to seeing you at our Building Modern Maintainable Javascript class. In order to prepare for the class, there are a few things that you'll need to install on your computers. JavaScript now has a tool chain almost as complicated as common server-side languages, but if we have all the tools in place before we get started, we'll be able to dive right into the content.

## Node and NPM

We will be using some server-side tools in order to build our components in the most efficient way possible. We need you to install a few things before class:

1. Node
    If you don't already have a recent version of Node installed, you can download it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Vue CLI
    The Vue CLI will simplify a lot of our build process and we'll be using it extensively in class. Run the command `npm install -g @vue/cli`. You may need to put a `sudo` in front of that if you are on Mac or Linux.
3. ESLint
    ESLint is a tool that will check our JavaScript code at compile time and give us helpful messages about what we might have messed up. I use it *all* the time. You can install it with `npm install -g eslint`, again, possibly with `sudo`.
4. Visual Studio Code
    VS Code is a very powerful coding editor that we will be using as the IDE for the class. It's not *required* for coding Vue, but it does have a lot of features that make working with Vue easier. You can download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/
5. VS Code Extensions
    The power of VS Code lives in its extensions. Once you open VS Code, you will see a little box icon on the left side. This will let you search for and install extensions. Please install the following before class:
    - ESLint
    - Vetur
    - Live Server

Once you have those installed, we'll be ready to go. We'll spend a little bit of time on the first day making sure everyone's environment is all set up, so if you get stuck on one of the above or have a question about them, we can figure that out on day one. But having these installed before class starts will make that much smoother.
